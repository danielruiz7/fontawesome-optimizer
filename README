## Introduction

So you use [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons in your project but there is a problem: fontawesome-all.js size is too much. 

With this node.js program you can generate an optimized version of fontawesome.js with only the icons used in yout project.

## Usage

Run 

```
node index.js path_to_your_project_directory path_to_output_file
```

The script will iterate over the .html files in your project looking for icons in the format <i class="faX fa-XXX"></i>, then it will generate a file with only thoose icons.
